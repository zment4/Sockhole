Sockhole - a sock searching game in GDevelop 5
for GGJ21 / FGJ21

Move your spaceship around and collect socks that come from the sockhole - a warp in spacetime that eats socks from all over the universe and drops them here. No one needs just one sock, so you need to find a pair for your collected sock. When you have a pair of socks found, go to base and unload and go and get more socks!
